Project Guitar Tab Writer
=========================================

Group Name: Guitar Studio
Group Members: Phillip Daniels, Marcus Kelly, and Logan Bailey.
Description: 
Our project, developed on the android platform, takes in live guitar playing and outputs the arrangement as guitar tablature. The app can recognize notes up to the 20th fret on each string and can recognize 10 different guitar chords. The user can save the recording into the internal storage of their phone, and can access it, edit and view it later. In addition to recording the arrangement, our app optimizes the tablature to place the notes as close together as possible. The user may also use the application to tune their guitar.
